This repository was created to keep track of data science learning progress, but also to share the sources I am using as more and more people kept asking me where to look for ML courses:

# My great knowledge sources (ranked starting from the preferred ones): 
a) Intro and Supervised Learning:
- pythonprogramming.com
- UCL Machine learning courses
- Victor Lavrenko Applied Machine Learning course at University of Edinburgh, short but very informative https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVz6Y8r5AkY&list=PLBv09BD7ez_7qIbBhyQDr-LAKWUeycZtx
- the famous Andrew Ng course from, Stanford University Coursera, it's decent for the first time for people with completely no previous expereience with ML https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

b)

# Different Machine learning cases:
