This repository was created to keep track of data science learning progress, but also to share the sources I am using as more and more people kept asking me where to look for ML courses:
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
### My knowledge sources split by topics (ranked starting from the preferred ones):

##### Intro and Supervised Learning:
- Undergraduate Machine Learning, Nando De Freitas, University British Columbia. The best machine learning course I have seen on the internet so far. Great explanation of maths and basic ML concepts like PCA
 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE6Wd9FR--Ecf_5nCbnSQMHqORpiChfJf
 
- Graduate Machine Learning, Nando De Freitas, University British Columbia. Can be treated as a continuation of the previous course.

- Youtube videos by Josh Starmer, very funny and entertaining, contain basic maths and ML concepts

- Victor Lavrenko Applied Machine Learning course at University of Edinburgh, short but very informative https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVz6Y8r5AkY&list=PLBv09BD7ez_7qIbBhyQDr-LAKWUeycZtx

- the famous Andrew Ng course from, Stanford University Coursera, it's decent for the first time for people with completely no previous expereience with ML

##### Natural Language Processing:
- Statistical NLP course at UCL, by 
https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book

##### Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning:
- Deep Learning at Oxford 2015, Nando de Freitas at University of Oxford.

- Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, Stanford. Although the topic seems advanced, the course covers also an introduction to ANNs.

##### Applied Machine Learning, intro to various libraries:
- pythonprogramming.com

### Different Machine learning cases:
- Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics. Very good for beginners
