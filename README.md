This repository was created to keep track of data science learning progress, but also to share the sources I am using as more and more people kept asking me where to look for ML courses:
### My knowledge sources split by topics (ranked starting from the preferred ones):

##### Intro and Supervised Learning:
- Undergraduate Machine Learning, Nando De Freitas, University British Columbia. The best machine learning course I have seen on the internet so far. Great explanation of maths and basic ML concepts like PCA etc. <br/>

- Graduate Machine Learning, Nando De Freitas, University British Columbia. Can be treated as a continuation of the previous course. <br/>

- Youtube videos by Josh Starmer, very funny and entertaining, contain basic maths and ML concepts <br/>

- UCL Machine learning courses <br/>
http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/

- Victor Lavrenko Applied Machine Learning course at University of Edinburgh, short but very informative <br/>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVz6Y8r5AkY&list=PLBv09BD7ez_7qIbBhyQDr-LAKWUeycZtx

- the famous Andrew Ng course from, Stanford University Coursera, it's decent for the first time for people with completely no previous expereience with ML <br/>

or <br/>

##### Natural Language Processing:
- Nice brief introduction to NLP, current challenges etc. Provided by Rachel Thomas from fast.ai. <br/>
https://github.com/fastai/course-nlp

- Introduction to NLP from Stanford University, by Dan Jurafsky and Chris Manning. Covers introduction, classical approaches and more statistical ML approaches (everything prior to Deep NLP). Also covers basics for information retrieval (basics of search engine). This course is probably the best online material to start your adventure with NLP. <br/>

- Stanford CS 224U - Natural Language Understanding by Dan Jurafsky. Covers word embeddings, sentiment analysis, evaluation metrics. As always from Stanford - very good stuff and takes only 15 hours to go through so it is useful material before jumping into Deep NLP. <br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ_Jrc_nRJY&list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20

- Stanford Deep Learning for NLP by Chris Manning. Covers introduction to Neural Networks, NN architectures applied to NLP problems such as Neural Translation and also recent advancements in the fiels such as Transformers and BERT. Crazy that this material is available for free online :). <br/>

##### Neural Networks, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning:
- Deep Learning at Oxford 2015, Nando de Freitas at University of Oxford. <br/>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV80NAlEins&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu

- Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition, Stanford. Although the topic seems advanced, the course covers also an introduction to ANNs. <br/>

##### Applied Machine Learning, intro to various libraries:
- pythonprogramming.com

### Different Machine learning cases:
- Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics. Very good for beginners <br/>
